Tequila, taco, and language enthusiast, Ximena also likes to dance, spend time with family and friends, and is always eager to learn new things, ANYthing. A proud Hufflepuff, Ximena is part of AIGA San Antonio, with the goal to elevate design and create a welcoming creative community for all.

## About Artifact Conference

ARTIFACT is an intimate, 2-day, single-track conference for web designers and developers. A third day of workshops allows attendees to deep-dive into design and development topics.

We are known for our all-star speaker line-ups, fostering a sense of camaraderie in the designer/developer community, and hosting memorable events. We got our start with events in 2013 where we addressed the challenges of designing for mobile devices. It's been five years since our last event, so we decided to get the gang back together for a special 5-year reunion event. In 2019, we expand our scope to creating inclusive sites that work not only for a multitude of devices, but also for all the people who use them.
